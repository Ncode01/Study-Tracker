# StudyQuest: Firebase Integration and Data Flow Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture, data structure, and Firebase integration of the StudyQuest application. It explains how data flows between Firebase (cloud) and local storage, addressing online and offline usage scenarios.

## System Architecture

StudyQuest uses a hybrid architecture with Firebase as the primary data store and local storage as a backup for offline functionality:

```

## Data Structure

### Firebase Collections

1. **users** - User profiles and authentication data
   - Fields: `id`, `email`, `displayName`, `username`, `points`, `streakData`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

2. **subjects** - Study subjects/courses
   - Fields: `id`, `userId`, `name`, `color`, `targetHours`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

3. **tasks** - Study tasks and assignments
   - Fields: `id`, `userId`, `subjectId`, `description`, `completed`, `priority`, `dueDate`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

4. **loggedSessions** - Study session records
   - Fields: `id`, `userId`, `subjectId`, `taskId`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `durationMinutes`, `notes`, `focusScore`, `distractionsLogged`, `tasksCompleted`, `materials`, `tags`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### Local Storage Structure

The application uses localStorage to maintain a copy of user data for offline use. Each user's data is stored under a unique key: `study-tracker-user-{userId}`.

The stored object structure mirrors the Firebase collections but is simplified into a single nested object:

```javascript
{
  subjects: Subject[],
  tasks: Task[],
  loggedSessions: LoggedSession[],
  points: number,
  streakData: {
    currentStreak: number,
    longestStreak: number,
    lastActiveDate: Date | null
  }
}
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**:
   - User enters email, password, and display name
   - Firebase Authentication creates the user account
   - A document is created in the `users` collection
   - Initial data (default subjects and tasks) is synced to Firebase
   - User is automatically logged in

2. **Sign In**:
   - User enters email and password
   - Firebase Authentication validates credentials
   - On successful authentication, user data is fetched from Firebase
   - If offline or Firebase fetch fails, data is loaded from localStorage
   - Firebase auth state listener automatically manages login state

3. **Sign Out**:
   - Current user data is saved to localStorage before logout
   - Firebase Authentication signs out the user
   - App state is reset

## Online/Offline Data Flow

### Online Operation

When the user is online:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Data is fetched directly from Firebase collections
   - Data is also cached in localStorage as a backup

2. **Data Creation/Modification**:
   - Changes are immediately applied to the local app state
   - Changes are sent to Firebase in real-time
   - Changes are saved to localStorage as a backup

### Offline Operation

When the user is offline:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Data is loaded from localStorage
   - User can interact with the app normally

2. **Data Creation/Modification**:
   - Changes are immediately applied to the local app state
   - Changes are saved to localStorage with temporary IDs (prefixed with "subj-", "task-", or "sess-")
   - A sync flag is set to indicate pending changes

### Sync Mechanism

When the user reconnects to the internet:

1. **Automatic Sync Detection**:
   - Online status is detected via browser's `navigator.onLine` property
   - The app listens for the `online` event to trigger syncing

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - The `syncWithFirebase` function is called automatically
   - Local data with temporary IDs is sent to Firebase
   - Firebase generates permanent IDs for new items
   - Local IDs are replaced with Firebase IDs in the app state
   - Updated data is saved back to localStorage

## ID Management

The application uses two types of IDs:

1. **Temporary Local IDs**:
   - Format: `{type}-{counter}` (e.g., "task-1", "subj-0")
   - Used for offline-created items
   - Managed via incrementing counters in the app state

2. **Firebase IDs**:
   - Auto-generated by Firebase (e.g., "7EGZAzDz9lX4NXm83vJZ")
   - Permanent IDs for all synchronized items
   - Replace temporary IDs after successful sync

## Optimistic Updates

The app uses an optimistic update pattern to provide a responsive user experience:

1. Update local state immediately
2. Persist to localStorage for offline backup
3. Send changes to Firebase if online
4. Handle any conflicts during synchronization

## Error Handling and Recovery

The application implements several strategies for error handling:

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - User-friendly error messages for auth issues
   - Fallback to demo accounts when Firebase auth is unavailable

2. **Network Errors**:
   - Automatic detection of online/offline status
   - Visual indicators of connection status
   - Automatic retry of failed operations when connection is restored

3. **Data Synchronization Errors**:
   - Logging of sync errors for debugging
   - Maintaining local state integrity despite sync failures
   - Automatic retry of synchronization

## Firebase Persistence

Firebase Firestore is configured with offline persistence enabled, which provides additional resilience:

1. **IndexedDB Storage**:
   - Firebase stores a copy of recently accessed data in the browser's IndexedDB
   - Allows for offline reads of previously accessed data
   - Automatically handles write operations when offline (queued until reconnection)

2. **Multi-Tab Considerations**:
   - Persistence is limited to one tab at a time
   - The app handles the "failed-precondition" error for multi-tab scenarios

## Performance Considerations

1. **Data Fetching Strategy**:
   - Fetch entire collections on initial load
   - Use real-time listeners sparingly to avoid excessive reads
   - Implement pagination for large datasets (future enhancement)

2. **Batched Writes**:
   - Batch write operations where possible to reduce network requests
   - Particularly useful during data synchronization

## Security Rules

Firebase security rules (implemented on the Firebase console) ensure:

1. **Authentication Enforcement**:
   - All operations require authentication
   - Users can only access their own data

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Required fields must be present
   - Field types must match expected types
   - Timestamps are automatically managed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Collaborative Features**:
   - Implement Firebase real-time listeners for collaborative study sessions
   - Enable sharing of subjects and tasks between users

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution for concurrent edits
   - Add versioning to detect and resolve conflicting changes

3. **Push Notifications**:
   - Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging for task reminders
   - Implement streak maintenance notifications

4. **Progressive Web App Features**:
   - Enhance offline capabilities with service workers
   - Implement background sync via IndexedDB
