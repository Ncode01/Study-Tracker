## Design Decisions

### Tech Stack Selection
- **React with TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Node.js with Express**: For a lightweight, flexible backend
- **MongoDB**: For schema flexibility to accommodate evolving features
- **Redux**: For predictable state management across the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development with responsive design
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, stateless authentication

### Authentication Implementation
- JWT token-based authentication for stateless, secure user sessions
- Password hashing with bcrypt for secure storage
- Protected route middleware for securing private endpoints
- Redux auth slice for client-side authentication state management

## Next Steps

1. Implement subject management system:
   - Create MongoDB schema for subjects
   - Implement CRUD operations for subjects
   - Develop subject management UI components
   - Add color-coding functionality

2. Develop dashboard features:
   - Create dashboard layout with widget grid
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality
   - Develop initial set of dashboard widgets
   - Implement dashboard layout persistence

3. Implement study timer functionality:
   - Develop timer UI components
   - Create session recording backend
   - Implement session statistics and reporting

## Open Questions/Issues

- Deployment strategy needs to be determined
- Data backup and recovery procedures to be established
- Specific Sri Lankan O/L curriculum subjects list needed
- Need to implement proper error handling throughout the application
- Need to address the duplicate `server/client/src/store/slices` directory that was created by mistake
